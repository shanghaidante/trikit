Volume Weighted Link Ratios/A2A Factors
Age2Ultimate Factors

Keep latest diagonal, and recursively populate upper-left
side of triangle for all periods

    * Multiply each period by the latest diagonal * the vol-wt-avg factor for 
      that period recursively until dev period 1
      
    * Take differences to obtain incremental triangle
      

* Calculate unscaled residuals: (original_inc - new_inc)/sqrt(new_inc)
    * first cell is blank
    First column: =IF(B65=0,0,((B18)-(B65))/SQRT(B65))
      =IF(ABS(M56-L56)<0.001,0,((M9-L9)-(M56-L56))/SQRT(M56-L56))

* Scale Factor =>
    * Calculate sum of squares of unscaled residuals
    * Number of Triangle Points
    * Scale Factor = SoS/(N - p)
    * Bias Adj = N^.5/(N - p)


* Normalize Pearson Residuals (to origin year - 1, to AY -1
  DEV_PERIODS 12-24, 24-36, 36-48, ... =>
  Unscaled Residual * BIAS_ADJUSTMENT
  First cell is average of 7-8 rows below => =AVERAGE(B111:B117)


* Sample from Normalized Residuals (create triangle of sampled results
  containing sampled residuals)

* Pseudo Incremental Paid Loss 
Incremental Paid Loss + Randomly Drawn Residual * SQRT(Recursive Incremental Triangle)

* Pseudo Cumulative Loss
 Cumulate Pseudo Incremental Paid Loss

* Pseudo Incurred Development Factors (Link Ratios)

* Vol Weighted Average
